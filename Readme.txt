Description:
----------------------------------
Fast Track Sites developed the Fast Track Sites Image Gallery System (FTSIGS) to allow users to easily create websites of their own with no programming required. FTSIGS was designed to be simple and easy to use. it is designed to be able to be installed and have a working site within seconds. 

The FREE version of FTSIGS has several features that allow users to create a fully functional and customizable web site. It includes a few of the original items that only FTSIGS comes with by default. The professional version comes with two skins, or themes if you will, that will give you a basic idea on how to make new ones. 

The professional version includes a 1yr warranty with full access to technical support by phone or email, multiple ways to create web pages, and much, much more. One of the biggest changes to the FTSIGS system that Fast Track Sites has made is the addition of the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) page editor. It allows you to see the basic look of your website without saving and loading it back up. 

FTSIGS sells for much less than other high priced content management systems with equal or less features.

In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.
